If you installed git you can clone the code to your machine, or download a ZIP of all the files directly.

[Download the ZIP from this location](https://github.com/AkshayIndraganti/Login-and-SignUp-Page/archive/master.zip), or run the following [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) command to clone the files to your machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AkshayIndraganti/Signup-And-Login-Page.git

- Once the files are on your machine, open the \_\_ folder in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

- With the files open in Visual Studio Code, press the **Go Live** button at the bottom of the window to launch the files with [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).
